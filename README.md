# What is it?

A calendar web app based on the fullcalendar library. It is a Single Page Application. The full-calendar library provides modules in ES so it doesn't need Browserify or any other solution to show JS in the browser. 

This README is a work-in-progress. See the [wiki tab](https://github.com/Husky-Coding-Project/calendar/wiki) or the issues for more details.

See [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BBly2RRFNrumXl5bWLurmyiKJDSaHddzope4JLPraA/edit#) for a list of small tasks and questions that aren't big enough to be issues on Github.

# PRIORITIES

- High: Event creation 
   - Affects: keyboard shortcuts regarding event creation, events interacting with the database somehow 
- High: Research how to make a Single Page Application
   - Affects: settings page, and pretty much everything 
   - Something to research: React and / or Express for making SPA
- Medium-high: settings popup. Customizability is a core part of our web app.
- Medium: Keyboard shortcuts
