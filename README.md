# What is it?

A calendar web app based on the fullcalendar library. It is a Single Page Application. The full-calendar library provides modules in ES so it doesn't need Browserify or any other solution to show JS in the browser. 

This README is a work-in-progress. See the wiki tab or the issues for more details.

See [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19BBly2RRFNrumXl5bWLurmyiKJDSaHddzope4JLPraA/edit#) for a list of small tasks and questions that aren't big enough to be issues on Github.
